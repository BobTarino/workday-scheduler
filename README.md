# workday-scheduler

Description: 

Created a calendar application, blending new hard-written code with prewritten code from an assortment of libraries (moment.js, jQuery, bootStrap, etc.) that will save and load tasks to the localStorage. 
Using an if/end statement, time-blocks containing task info will change color based on the time of day.
